# Requirements
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
* All your functions should be type annotated
# 0. Regex-ing

Write a function called filter_datum that returns the log message obfuscated:

* Arguments:
    * fields: a list of strings representing all fields to obfuscate
    * redaction: a string representing by what the field will be obfuscated
    * message: a string representing the log line
    * separator: a string representing by which character is separating all fields in the log line (message)
* The function should use a regex to replace occurrences of certain field values.
* filter_datum should be less than 5 lines long and use re.sub to perform the substitution with a single regex
